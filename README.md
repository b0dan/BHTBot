# BHTBot
This is a bot created for a game related discord server.


The BHTBot keeps track of everyone who joins and leaves the server, notifies the triads(users) about sssnakes(those that left) and creates contracts(this one's game related) of them. You can use several commands to modify the contracts as long as you're in the right channel and have the right roles.

You can also play Rock-Paper-Scissors against it!
